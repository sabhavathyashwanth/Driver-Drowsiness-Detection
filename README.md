# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real time and alert them to prevent accidents. By analyzing the driver's facial expressions and eye movements, the system identifies signs of fatigue and triggers an alarm to ensure safety.

Key Features:

Real-time Monitoring: Uses a webcam or built-in camera to continuously track the driver’s face.
Eye & Face Detection: Detects eye closure, yawning, and head position to determine drowsiness.
Alert System: Sounds an alarm when drowsiness is detected, prompting the driver to stay alert or take a break.
Machine Learning-Based Detection: Utilizes deep learning models for accurate and efficient recognition.
Accident Prevention: Helps reduce the risk of accidents by ensuring drivers remain attentive.
Technologies Used:

Python – For backend programming and model integration.
OpenCV – For image processing and facial landmark detection.
Deep Learning (CNNs, TensorFlow/PyTorch) – To classify drowsy vs. awake states.
Sound Alerts (PyGame/Playsound) – To generate warning alarms.
Working Mechanism:

The system captures video frames of the driver’s face.
Facial features like eyes, mouth, and head posture are analyzed using machine learning models.
If drowsiness indicators (e.g., prolonged eye closure or yawning) exceed a threshold, an alert is triggered.
The driver is warned with an alarm to regain focus or take a break.
Impact:
This project enhances road safety by minimizing drowsiness-related accidents, making it beneficial for long-distance drivers, transportation companies, and personal vehicle owners.
