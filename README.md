# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
This is my Mini-B.Tech Project. It's a developed project for finding the drowsiness of a driving while in motion. When the system notices the drowsy signs of the driver, itâ€™ll sound an alarm to wake up the  driver or remind them to take a break. So, with this some accidents can be prevented and saving the lives of the drivers.
